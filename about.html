            Since the first time that I pressed the start button on my family's computer 
            over 20 years ago I gained a love and an interest in the possibilities of knowing
            how to work a computer gave me.    
            Back then I explored all the files and folders that I could get myself into, even
            if I didn’t know what they did, there was a certain magical feeling that I could 
            find something interesting, like the character models of a long and forgotten game.  
        </p>
        <p>
            That curiosity was further explored by movies and series like The Matrix and Mr. Robot 
            until I decided to learn python last year through a Udemy course. At the time I was working 
            in the hospitality industry, as a bartender, all that came to a full stop when the pandemic struck.   
            With all the time in the world, I started to realize what a precarious world we live in, I couldn’t stop 
            the feeling that I had to do something about my future. For some time even before the lockdown, 
            I was unhappy about the lack of growth possibilities that hospitality has to offer. Luckily,
            I stumbled across Northcoders on Reddit.

            This would be my gateway to the world of software development and the start of my career. 
            From the moment that I applied to the Bootcamp, I had to start learning on my own to pass the
            technical entry challenge. That long-lost kid that first saw the Windows starting logo suddenly
            awoke and I found myself learning and doing coding almost daily. I passed the entry challenge and 
            can proudly say that I’m a Northcoders student. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The path hasn’t been the smoothest, but I’m confident that this gem of a Bootcamp will catapult 
            me to the moon, equipped with knowledge of asynchronous code, APIs, and recursion. This technical 
            wisdom allied with all the core soft skills that hospitality gave me, like working in a team, being 
            a good communicator and an understanding of interpersonal relationships in the workspace makes me 
            believe that I am a good addition to any company ready to invest even more on my education.
