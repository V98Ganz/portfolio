        Since the first time that I pressed the start button on my family's
        computer over 20 years ago I gained a love and an interest in the
        possibilities of knowing how to work a computer gave me. Back then I
        explored all the files and folders that I could get myself into, even if
        I didn’t know what they did, there was a certain magical feeling that I
        could find something interesting, like the character models of a long
        and forgotten game.
      </p>
      <p>
        That curiosity was further explored by movies and series like The Matrix
        and Mr. Robot until I decided to learn python last year through a Udemy
        course. At the time I was working in the hospitality industry, as a
        bartender, all that came to a full stop when the pandemic struck. With
        all the time in the world, I started to realize what a precarious world
        we live in, I couldn’t stop the feeling that I had to do something about
        my future. For some time even before the lockdown, I was unhappy about
        the lack of growth possibilities that hospitality has to offer. Luckily,
        I stumbled across Northcoders on Reddit.
      </p>

        This would be my gateway to the world of software development and the
        start of my career. From the moment that I applied to the Bootcamp, I
        had to start learning on my own to pass the technical entry challenge.
        That long-lost kid that first saw the Windows starting logo suddenly
        awoke and I found myself learning and doing coding almost daily. I
        passed the entry challenge and can proudly say that I’m a Northcoders
        student.
      </p>
      <p>
        The path hasn’t been the smoothest, but I’m confident that this gem of a
        Bootcamp will catapult me to the moon, equipped with knowledge of
        asynchronous code, APIs, and recursion. This technical wisdom allied
        with all the core soft skills that hospitality gave me, like working in
        a team, being a good communicator and an understanding of interpersonal
        relationships in the workspace makes me believe that I am a good
        addition to any company ready to invest even more on my education.
